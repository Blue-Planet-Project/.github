_<h3 align="center">"A label to make the difference"</h3>_

The Blue Planet Project is a set of labels and partners in order to assure a quality standard on the product that users purchase every day. For each label that the company owns, they went through a series of scientifical tests, and socio-economical evaluations, to make sure that their product matched the quality standard that Blue Planet wants to advocate.

This organization is the collection of all repositories that made the Blue Planet Project possible, from the website, to the application, including all the tools to manage our research and experiments.
